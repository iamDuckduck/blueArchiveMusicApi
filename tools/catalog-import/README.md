# Local catalog review

Requires Python 3.11+, FFmpeg and FFprobe on PATH. From this directory:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8765. Load Kivo details, include the Veritas album,
prepare its audio and artwork, review the source evidence and edit the credits.
Save changes to keep your corrections across restarts. The page previews the
validated audio and keeps the spoken drama reference excluded.

Fetching reads source metadata and file URLs. Preparation downloads and validates
those files, reads embedded tags and creates 400/800 px cover copies. GameKee
requests can fail; the saved error and manual reference remain available.

The ignored `data/` directory contains SQLite reviews and prepared media.
Stop the tool and back up that whole directory before moving your saved work.
Use `--data-dir` for a separate review directory and `--port` for another port.

Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` for the source, preparation,
persistence and local browser-API tests. Fixtures and temporary files keep these
tests independent from live source services.

This chapter demonstrates one local sample review. Later chapters add backend
publication, general discovery and review of incoming changes.
